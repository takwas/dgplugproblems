[15:21:14] <kushal> Try to come online 5 minutes before the session starts.
[15:21:14] <kushal> Address people by their IRC nick.

[15:22:21] <SRvSaha> My query is solved thanks :)
[15:22:29] <mr-karan> Is there any schedule available kushal
[15:22:32] <kushal> CuriousLearner, it is cleared now.
[15:22:34] <kushal> mr-karan, Nope.
[15:22:52] <shashank> !
[15:22:55] <abhi2016> !
[15:22:56] <kushal> We expect people to come online regularly on IRC

[15:22:58] <vharsh> !
[15:23:06] <kushal> That is another part of the training.
[15:23:15] <deeksha19> !
[15:23:17] <ketank> kushal what if we miss the session??
[15:23:17] <kushal> In Open Source/FOSS world, we use IRC a lot.
[15:23:29] <pritam1122> !
[15:23:43] <kushal> But you should first make an habit of coming online, and chatting with people here.
[15:23:43] <Love_Guru_> not a question , but it would be great if we got to know about the Topic of the session well in advance!
[15:23:54] <rbajaj_> kushal, can you set the mode to +m.
[15:24:10] <kushal> Remember to respect others.

[15:25:25] <anushil_> clear
[15:25:31] <vharsh> is \o or \0 equivalent to <EOF> or <EOM>? I saw some people writing it after the message, before the session began. So that's way up.
[15:25:31] <kushal> deeksha19, you should type ! and wait.

[15:26:41] <kushal> A modern linux that is.
[15:27:06] <deeksha19> thanks
[15:27:06] <kushal> .link faq
[15:27:08] <SRvSaha> vharsh: <eof> is the universal way of doing that in IRC meetings
[15:27:16] <sayan> vharsh: \o is a notation to "hi" (waving hand gesture)
[15:27:18] <kushal> Please read the faq document.
[15:27:22] <kushal> next
[15:27:24] <pritam1122> will we have some interactive sessions?
[15:27:39] <kushal> pritam1122, almost all sessions are interactive sessions.
[15:28:03] <surajd> pritam1122, we are having it already!
[15:28:10] <pritam1122> I mean simultaneuos working on some thing?
[15:28:20] <kushal> In future yes.
[15:28:38] <kushal> So few more points to remember:
[15:28:49] <kushal> Always type full English words on IRC or mails.
[15:29:02] <kushal> Means no "u", it is you.
[15:29:46] <kushal> There are a few abbreviations like http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/abbreviations.html
[15:30:41] <kushal> The next link is about things to do before asking a question.

[15:35:26] <kushal> For the first 1-2 days we will go through these communication related notes, and then we will move to next things.
[15:35:49] <kushal> Please remember this as very important, as most people fail to communicate properly.
[15:36:05] <kushal> So learning these basic skills will help you life long.

[15:51:30] <kushal> pabitra, I also gave another link about asking smart questions.
[15:51:31] <SRvSaha> pabitra: batul is basically a bot : Technically speaking a script written in Python to automate task
[15:51:52] <kushal> pabitra,^^ everyone wants to see the code for this bot, we will share it at the end.
[15:52:09] <kushal> next
[15:52:17] <pabitra> ok got it...
[15:52:17] <punarvasu510> Hi all!

[15:53:02] <FazlurRahman> Hi kushal sir i am late
[15:53:16] <kushal> anushil_, you will learn that in the later sessions.
[15:53:22] <SRvSaha> pabitra: So Kushal has written the script and hence the bot which works as his assistance when the queue of questions comes in. When everyone keeps pressing ! ,it keeps track of that in a wueue and with every next command from kushal the queue is update
[15:53:33] <kushal> FazlurRahman, no problem, and you don't have to call anyone sir or madam on internet.
[15:53:43] <kushal> next
[15:53:46] <rahuldecoded__> how long this entire training will take? Will you be in touch after this training?
[15:53:50] <ritesh> !

[15:54:04] <abhishekg5> anushil_:  You'll be able to that once you follow the training sessions
[15:54:15] <kushal> rahuldecoded__, we actually never end the training, people generally become part of dgplug through this.
[15:54:23] <kushal> rahuldecoded__, the sessions goes for 3 months.
[15:54:26] <kushal> next
[15:54:28] <srinidhi> I somehow got disconnected a few minutes ago, but no alert in xchat(I thought everyone were quiet). How to test the connection? Also making batul op seems a good move to me!
[15:54:29] <nikhil07> where i can get the log of todays session
[15:54:49] <kushal> nikhil07, you will get it after the session.
[15:54:52] <pabitra> |!

[15:55:06] <ShaswataD> Kushal, What is the meaning of +1 as being used by everyone and you?
[15:55:18] <prashaant> nikhil07, you can start logging in Xchat : goto settings  > preferences >> logging
[15:55:23] <kushal> ShaswataD, just  a way to say I agree.
[15:55:28] <kushal> next
[15:55:29] <Rich99> @kushal My name is Mayank Gupta and i'm the younger brother of Shreyank Gupta (shrink). He told me to inform you.
[15:55:31] <ShaswataD> Roger

[15:57:19] <iyogeshjoshi> why*
[15:57:33] <anushil_> when i was using fedora i was always stuck in infinite login loop
[15:57:37] <kushal> iyogeshjoshi, We think it is a better distribution for developers.

[15:57:48] <ShaswataD> +1
[15:57:51] <SpEcHiDe> !

[15:58:52] <PrashantJ> !
[15:58:55] <sayan> FazlurRahman: that would be told at the end of each session
[15:58:59] <SRvSaha> kushal: It's kind of logging issue due to some sort of high graphics.
[15:59:02] <kushal> FazlurRahman, before asking a question you should type ! and then wait for your turn to speak.
[15:59:07] <anushil_> if i enter my password ,it ask agian and again to enter the password
[15:59:08] <iyogeshjoshi> kushal: infinite loop, I guess when their desktop manager fails to load
[15:59:11] <prashaant> !
[15:59:22] <kushal> Use a different desktop manager :)
[15:59:27] <kushal> We can help you in that.
